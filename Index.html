                <h1>Hi, I'm Ryan Garvin. I am currently finishing up my BA in Software Engineering.
                    <br>Last summer I was working at a repair shop where I was a Repair Technician and I also have volunteer experience for FIRST robotics competitions
                    <br>helping kids with the robots they were building, and answering any questions they had.
                    <br>In my free time I enjoy working on  personal coding projects which you can view on my github(https://github.com/Ryanerror).
                    <br>Overall, I'm extremely passionate about the software industry,
                    <br>and am currently looking for an internship role.</h1>
